token_bucket.py

Token bucket rate limiting algorithm

Allows controlled bursting up to bucket capacity while enforcing
an average rate over time. Tokens refill at a constant rate, and
each request consumes one token. Good for APIs where occasional
traffic spikes are acceptable as long as the average stays within
bounds. The bucket capacity sets the maximum burst size.

Connects to:
